When I worked at Ita√∫, it was necessary to extract data of individuals who had court-ordered alimony payments to be debited from their checking accounts. 
We had to receive a batch of TXT files, filter these individuals based on business rules, and we used pandas for that. 
After this extraction, it was necessary to check which accounts had sufficient balance, moving on to the data transformation process. 
Finally, the account was debited, and a payment receipt was generated.
